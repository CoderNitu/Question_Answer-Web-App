# Question_Answer_Web_App

A natural language processing (NLP) question-answering (QA) system is a computer program that uses AI to understand the meaning and context of questions and provide accurate answers. The goal is to create a system that can understand the context of a question, search for relevant information, and present an accurate answer. Here, I learn how to load a pre-trained language model for question-answering tasks in our system along with dependencies like transformers and Pytorch using the NLP pipeline to configure . Then I create a web app for it using Anvil, which allows me to build a free Python-based drag-and-drop web app and deploy it over the cloud.
