# Question_Answering_Web_App

A natural language processing (NLP) question-answering (QA) system is a computer program that uses AI to understand the meaning and context of questions and provide accurate answers. The goal is to create a system that can understand the context of a question, search for relevant information, and present an accurate answer. Here, I learn how to load a pre-trained language model for question-answering tasks in our system along with dependencies like transformers and Pytorch using the NLP pipeline to configure. Then I create a web app for it using Anvil, which allows me to build a free Python-based drag-and-drop web app and deploy it over the cloud. 

## Question-Answering Model

Question-answering models can retrieve the answer to a question from a given text, which is useful for searching for an answer in a document. Some question-answering models can generate answers without context such as ChatGPT, Julias AI, etc. Context means passage(A paragraph from an article or blog)/corpus/snippets which we need to provide our model, ask questions from it, and get a result as an output, that plays an alternative to the process of Reading comprehension (the ability to read a piece of text(context) and then answer questions about it) which our model does for us.
